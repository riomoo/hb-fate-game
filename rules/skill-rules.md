# Rules about certain skills

    Discussing the proper functions of Notice and Investigate as skills in this campaign.
    - Notice is primarily flat not made with rolls, and only deals with seeing details
      of the present and not the past or the ability to guess what has occurred in the past.
        ex ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
            GM: "Once you three arrive in this room, there's a foul smell in the air."
            Player 1: "I would like to use my notice of +2 to determine the scent."
            GM: "It's blood. and a lot of it."
           ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        Here this example shows the possible usage of Notice and how important it can be in
        this detective style game. The intensity grows with value of Notice. You can also try
        to add a roll to it to determine where the smell is coming from, or if its old or fresh.
        But not how old or how fresh. Just if its warm or cold. Determining exact time of death
        or age of the blood would require Investigate.

    - Investigate primarily focuses on things that has happened already not the present,
      and can only be used in rolls to determine things.
        ex ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
            GM: "Now, you've found the body. Your Notice let you see that there's a
                 blade wound in his back and he's laying on his stomach."
            Player 2: "I'm going check for marks on the floor with a roll for my
                       Investigate to a see if there was a fight or if he was attacked
                       from behind." Rolls "+2 Natural adding on +1 from the roll
                       makes it a +3"
            GM: "It seems there was no real fight, which means he was attacked
                 from behind."
           ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    This is one very limited use of Investigate compared to or with Notice.
    Please modify and use this to your digression.
