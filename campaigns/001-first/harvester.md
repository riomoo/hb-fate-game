# The Harvester

    The day will begin as every does at the detective business. Waiting for a client to call or arrive. But after some time the players getting a feel for the more relaxed nature. Eventually someone new to hell will appear near their place of work. They won't have any money but they can promise to pay them if they figure out how they died.

    This Sinner (named Catherine) who had just died will be frantic, why are they dead? What happened to their dog (specific breed here) ? but they promise to work off the debt if they can just find out who killed them and took her dog, she can move on in this afterlife. The last thing she remembered was two loud bangs like rocks being hit together and then a pain in her back and she died.

    They'll be told by her where the crime took place. The players will be able to use their Asmo-Crystal to to teleport to the crime scene. There will be a few cops and an Investigator by the name of Tim/Timmothy. The cops will allow them to enter because Tim allows them to investigate. He'll tell them something along the lines of "If it has something to do with Hell, don't call me. If it doesn't, let me know, I'll be back at the station."

    They will then examine the area, hopefully checking the corpse. They'll need a decent notice of +2 to see the wound in her back that reveals a very smooth ball of rock lodged inside her.

    If they use Investigate and roll above a +2 they'll see another rock, same smoothness lodged into a tree. If less they'll need to look harder at the trees specifically to try again. the tragectory can be determined with an Academic roll above a +1, a Notice +3 or higher (No Roll), or an Investigate roll of +2 or higher.

    This will lead them to a bush where a phone can be found and some shoe prints.
    The phone will be unlocked and reveal the location of a dog kennel. A place for breeding the same breed the Sinner had. There's nothing in the contacts like they were cleared.
    
    Upon going to this dog kennel a sweet old lady will be startled by the players and their forms. but will just assume its a costume. when they ask about the dog she will say that she was sold one recently and they smelled really bad, like a corpse. but she gave him (sum of money here) for the dog. And he left into the woods and she'll point out exactly which way he went. But warns that the only thing that way is a cemetery.
