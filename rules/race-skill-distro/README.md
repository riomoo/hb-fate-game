# Skill Distrobution by race

- This is primarily a detective game
- Combat isn't the main focus but it is needed for certain cases

- Goetia, Sinners, and the like are NOT allowed purely because
  they cannot be beaten by normal means unless someone has
  incredible magic or angelic/holy/equivalent weapons.

- If you can figure out a way to make them fair and balanced for
  your game, make a pull request or suggestion and I'll potentially
  add it for this repo.

- I only included the major races because I figured that's all
  that anyone would need.
