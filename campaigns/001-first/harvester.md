# The Harvester

    The day will begin as every does at the detective business. Waiting for a client to call or arrive. But after some time the players getting a feel for the more relaxed nature. Eventually someone new to hell will appear near their place of work. They won't have any money but they can promise to pay them if they figure out how they died.

    This Sinner (named Catherine) who had just died will be frantic, why are they dead? What happened to their dog (specific breed here) ? but they promise to work off the debt if they can just find out who killed them and took her dog, she can move on in this afterlife. The last thing she remembered was two loud bangs like rocks being hit together and then a pain in her back and she died.

    They'll be told by her where the crime took place. The players will be able to use their Asmo-Crystal to to teleport to the crime scene. There will be a few cops and an Investigator by the name of Tim/Timmothy. The cops will allow them to enter because Tim allows them to investigate. He'll tell them something along the lines of "If it has something to do with Hell, don't call me. If it doesn't, let me know, I'll be back at the station."

    They will then examine the area, hopefully checking the corpse. They'll need a decent notice of +2 to see the wound in her back that reveals a very smooth ball of rock lodged inside her.

    If they use Investigate and roll above a +2 they'll see another rock, same smoothness lodged into a tree. If less they'll need to look harder at the trees specifically to try again. the tragectory can be determined with an Academic roll above a +1, a Notice +3 or higher (No Roll), or an Investigate roll of +2 or higher.

    This will lead them to a bush where a phone can be found and some shoe prints.
    The phone will be unlocked and reveal the location of a dog kennel. A place for breeding the same breed the Sinner had. There's nothing in the contacts like they were cleared.
    
    Upon going to this dog kennel a sweet old lady will be startled by the players and their forms. but will just assume its a costume. when they ask about the dog she will say that she was sold one recently and they smelled really bad, like a corpse. but she gave him (sum of money here) for the dog. And he left into the woods and she'll point out exactly which way he went. But warns that the only thing that way is a cemetery.

    Going there they will hear talking before the sound of an Asmo-Crystal and then there will only be one voice muttering to themselves about their payment following the sound of eating. If they approach they will see the sight of a ghoul eating something. This ghoul is named Mike, he's not evil, nor does he attack people. He normally lives off of organs in cemetaries but his Boss has been supplying him with freshly dead organs. He's hard to talk too because he's a little dim but he's nice and is willing to help, they need to coherse him about the phone they found and his boss.

    Done successfully, Mike will offer his phone to them with the number of his boss inside which just so happens to be the phone they are holding onto. Mikes roll is very simple, do what his boss says, in this case, sell the dog, get the money, get organs for food.

    Further questioning with either a Contacts roll of +2, a Rapport roll of +2 or a Empathy roll of +2 will have Mike disclose where his Boss gets the organs. Which is from a medical building that looks like a massive mirror and he's going there to havest a freshly killed body that just showed up.

    There will be human guards but they only have a Notice of +1. If your players roll a +2 or higher Stealth they will not be seen by them. Reaching the second floor of this building, If one of your players has a Notice is +1 or higher they can hear the sound of flesh being carved and someone humming a tune. Opening the door they'll see a short human male, long hair, hat, and surgical tools removing and bottling organs from the clients body.

    The door will sqeek on opening it to look at them and he'll notice every player reguardless of Stealth. Addressing them by making an Asmo-Portal using his ring and pulling everyone into his bar,in Hell. Once in his bar he'll remove his disguise and reveal himself as an Imp pulling out a rock from his coat pocket and pealing it with his thumb nail until its perfectly round, just like the ones he used to kill the client. He introduces himself as Nael and explains that he exchanges human dollars at a 2 to 1 ratio for Souls here in hell.

    Talking back and fourth he'll explain more saying he kills someone, uses Mike or someone other creature with no common sense to sell the items on their body, take the cash and pay them with organs or something else other than cash. Rinse and repeat.
    
    He will start the fight by shooting one of those rocks at one of the players. They'll have to fight until they kill him.

    Nael's Stats are +2 in everything except Fight that is a +1. All of his attacks involve flicking those rocks as fast as a bullet, using Shoot to land attacks. He has Six stress boxes. all six must be filled for him to be defeated.

    If any player goes down during this fight, he will attempt to finish them off once but never again. to finish someone off he will need to not be hit for 1 full turn after he takes aim to do so, attempt to put one of those rocks through their head, this cannot miss and can only be stopped by hitting him once. Players finished off by this attack are effectively gone.
    
       After beating him, he will also be effectively gone. The players can find an expensive freshly bought bottle of alcohol and may close out the game with the conclusion from the Sinner they took the case for, giving her thanks.
